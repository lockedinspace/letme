<p align="center">A <b>reliable</b>, <b>secure</b> and <b>fast</b> way to switch between AWS accounts from the CLI. </p>

## Documentation

Learn more about letme: [visit the complete and most up-to-date documentation](https://www.getletme.com/).

## Why letme
As AWS cloud administrators, we have found that:

1. **It is not easy to manage** credentials for different accounts and **follow AWS best practices** at the same time.
   
2. There is no common way to define the process of obtaining/updating/managing those credentials, **we wanted a centralized way to manage credentials**.

3. No more _"On my local computer works."_ since we implemented a centralized way to obtain and manage credentials.

## Requirements

- Go (+1.22).
- AWS CLI (v2).

## Install Letme

- [Through go cli (recommended)](#go-cli)
- [Building from source](#building-from-source)
